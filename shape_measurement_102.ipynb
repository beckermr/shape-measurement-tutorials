    "## C. Metadetection/Metacalibration in real data with `ngmix`\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats! By completing exercise 2 of this tutorial you have coded up an extremely simple, but non-trivial form of the `metacalibration` weak lensing shape measurement technique!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from here to applying this to real observed galaxies involves a lot of complications. Namely\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We don't know the true underlying surface brightness profile of real galaxies. Thus we cannot directly compute the response from the unsheared surface brightness profile like we did above.\n",
    "2. Real galaxies are observed through telescopes and we need to account for this effect when computing the response.\n",
    "3. Images of real galaxies have noise in them. If we take an image with noise in it and shear the image, we will get correlated noise which can cause bias in our shape measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions to these problems are the subject of years of research, so I'll give you the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instead of using the true surface brightness profile of an object, we use the observed image of the object itself. We can do this because the shear applied by nature is small, so that the difference between the response computed using the observed object and that using the true object is even smaller. This process generates a *counter-factual* image of the object at another shear, hence the title above.\n",
    "2. We measure the PSF of the telescope and atmosphere using stars around the galaxy. We can then use this observed PSF to remove these effects via a process called deconvolution. This process cannot fully recover the galaxy as it would look without the telescope and atmosphere, but it can remove enough of these effects for our purposes.\n",
    "3. We can apply special noise corrections to our images which account for the correlated noise. The details of this process are unimportant except to say that if we don't we see 5% to 10% biases our measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these algorithms have been coded up into two packages, `metadetect` and `ngmix`. These are the main tools you will be using. The next exercise introduces them to you and generates the first kinds of simulations you'll run to test shape measurement.\n",
