    "\n",
    "Stepping back a bit, let's learn about how our Universe relates to the things we did above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**galaxies**: We introduced the concept of an object's surface brightness profile above, defined as the value of an image of the object at a given location $(x,y)$. Of course, in our Universe, objects don't actually follow the simple Gaussian profile we used above. Instead, galaxies form out of the gravitational collapse of dark matter and baryons into dark matter halos with galaxies at their centers. This process is exceedingly complex. For our work, instead of using the true surface brightness profile of a galaxy, we use simplified approximations, like a Gaussian profile. These approximations help us in multiple ways, including making our computations faster in some cases and making the results of our computations easier to understand. So, TL;DR, the surface brightness profiles we used above and below are simplified models for true galaxies that help make science easier to do. The issue of how we ensure our methods will work on galaxies the universe generates is a serious one, but something we won't discuss here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**shears**: Now that we know what a surface brightness profile is and we have some moments computed, we are ready to think about shear. A *shear* is a specific mathematical transformation of a galaxy surface brightness profile. (Instead of coding this transformation up ourselves, we are going to have `galsim` do this for us. Yay!) This operation is highly relevant to our own Universe due to an effect called *weak gravitational lensing*. It turns out one of the foundational predictions of General Relativity is that the paths of light rays change in response to the presence of matter (e.g., us and everything else) near them. Weak gravitational lensing is this effect computed from all of the matter in the Universe along the line-of-sight from us to distant galaxies observed by telescopes. Fractionally, this effect is indeed very weak, causing a relative change of only 1% in the moments of the surface brightness profiles of distant galaxies. The goal of a shape measurement method is to extract the amplitude of this shear, which carries information about the matter along the line of sight and other properties of the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**telescopes**: After the light from a galaxy has passed through various structures along the line-of-sight, it enters our atmosphere and then the telescope. The combination of the atmosphere and the telescope blurs the image of the galaxy. We characterize this blurring through a quantity called the *point-spread function* or PSF. The PSF describes how light from a single, point-like object is spread out over the image. A galaxy is an extended object, which you can roughly think of as composed of an infinite number of points of light coming towards. To predict what the galaxy will look like after the atmosphere and telescope, we can take the surface brightness at each point on the galaxy, spread it out according to the PSF, and then deposit that spread out light onto our image. Mathematically, this operation is called a *convolution* and we say that the galaxy has been *convolved with the PSF*. Let's not worry about the mathematical details of convolutions for now. Instead, we will let `galsim` do them for us!\n",

    "For this exercise do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a pixel grid with 53 pixels on each side and scale of 0.25, plot the PSF, galaxy and the convolution of the two. Use the objects in the example convolution we just discussed.\n",
    "2. Measure the moments of each of the PSF, galaxy, and the convolution.\n",
    "3. Plot the moment $M_{xx}$ of the convolved object as a function of the moment $M_{xx}$ of the PSF as you change the PSF size `sigma` from 0.5 to 1.0. What is the relationship between the two?\n",
    "4. Repeat 3 but this time changing the size `sigma` of the galaxy from 1 to 2 and measuring $M_{xx}$ of the convolved object with respect to the moment $M_{xx}$ of the input galaxy. Before you make the plot, write down what do you expect to see and why?\n",
    "5. Repeat 1 through 4, but this time using `gal = galsim.Exponential(half_light_radius=1)` and varying the `half_light_radius` instead of `sigma`. Do you see the same relationship? Why can you conclude about how this might approximately work in general?"
